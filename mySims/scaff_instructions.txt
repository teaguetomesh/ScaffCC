Compiling ScaffCC:
When compiling on cafe, have to use "sudo make USE_GCC=1"

Instructions for running scaffCC simulations
Example is Yipeng's ground state estimation algorithm trying to recreate the
Lanyon nature paper's estimation of the H2 ground state.


Simply run the iterative_phase_estimation_qchem.py which iterates over multiple 
calls to Yipeng's algorithm:

  ./scripts/simulations/iterative_phase_estimation_qchem.py [scaffold file to run]

To run a single instance, have to run the simulate.sh file by:

  ./scripts/simulation/simulate.sh [scaffold file to run]


The simulate.sh file generates:
  .global_phase.output    -> Qx simulator output
  .no_global_phase.output -> Qx simulator output
  .qasmf                  -> flat qasm code
  .qasmh                  -> hierarchical qasm code
  .qc                     -> generates code nearly identical to .qasm files


Run: ./scaffold.sh -help
To get a listing of different flags and options

USING QX SIMULATOR

The QX simulator is found in ScaffCC/scripts/qx_simulator_linux_x86_64/
The pdf documentation is found in that same folder/docs

It can be useful to call the simulator directly as

  scripts/qx_simulator_linux_x86_64/qx_simulator_1.0.beta_linux_x86_64 hamiltonian_averaging.qc > hamiltonian_averaging.qc.output

This way you can edit the .qc files to insert more display commands to see the quantum state at
different points in the circuit.

Unfortunately, QX does not have a measX capability, so scaffold files with the MeasX() function
will throw an error when trying to convert them to .qc format.
